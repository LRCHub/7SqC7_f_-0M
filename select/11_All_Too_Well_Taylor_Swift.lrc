[00:20.45] I walked through the door with you
[00:23.32] The air was cold
[00:25.62] But something about it felt like home somehow
[00:30.14] And I, left my scarf there at your sister's house
[00:35.48] And you've still got it in your drawer even now
[00:58.98] 
[00:51.14] Oh, your sweet disposition
[00:53.88] And my wide-eyed gaze
[00:56.64] We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
[01:01.94] Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
[01:06.39] And I can picture it after all these days
[01:26.89] 
[01:11.89] And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
[01:17.36] And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
[01:38.86] 
[01:27.74] 'Cause there we are again on that little town street
[01:32.91] You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
[01:37.23] Wind in my hair, I was there
[01:39.96] I remember it all too well
[01:52.96] 
[01:48.15] Photo album on the counter
[01:50.95] Your cheeks were turning red
[01:53.00] You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
[01:58.26] And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
[02:03.70] You told me 'bout your past thinking your future was me
[02:31.20] 
[02:08.29] And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do
[02:14.06] And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to
[02:44.06] 
[02:24.38] 'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
[02:29.68] We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
[02:34.12] Down the stairs, I was there
[02:36.62] I remember it all too well, yeah
[02:52.62] 
[02:59.67] And maybe we got lost in translation
[03:02.66] Maybe I asked for too much
[03:04.94] But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
[03:10.16] Running scared, I was there
[03:12.91] I remember it all too well
[03:25.91] 
[03:20.86] And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
[03:26.28] So casually cruel in the name of being honest
[03:30.96] I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
[03:35.05] 'Cause I remember it all, all, all
[03:43.73] Too well
[03:47.73] 
[03:55.14] Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
[03:59.90] I'd like to be my old self again
[04:02.08] But I'm still trying to find it
[04:05.04] After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
[04:10.09] Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
[04:15.13] But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
[04:20.28] 'Cause it reminds you of innocence
[04:23.11] And it smells like me
[04:24.97] You can't get rid of it
[04:27.65] 'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
[04:48.15] 
[04:36.06] 'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
[04:41.22] Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
[04:46.05] It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
[05:12.05] 
[04:56.03] Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
[05:01.03] Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
[05:06.54] It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
